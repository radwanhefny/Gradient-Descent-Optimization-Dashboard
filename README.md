# 📊 Gradient Descent Optimization Dashboard

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** visualizing how **Learning Rate (α)** and **Iterations** affect Multivariate Linear Regression trained using **Gradient Descent From Scratch**.  
Built to demonstrate **model convergence** and **hyperparameter tuning** insights for ML beginners and practitioners.

---

## ✨ Dashboard Features
- R² score vs learning rate and iterations.
- Cost function visualization for convergence tracking.
- Scatter plots showing feature-target relationships.
- Dark theme with neon highlights for better visibility. 
- Fully interactive slicers & tooltips.
