# 📊 Gradient Descent Optimization Dashboard

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** visualizing the effect of **Learning Rate (α)** and **Iterations** on the performance of Linear Regression trained using Gradient Descent.  
This helps demonstrate model convergence behavior and hyperparameter tuning insight.

---

## ✨ Dashboard Features
- R² score vs learning rate and iterations  
- Cost function visualization for convergence tracking  
- Scatter plots comparing predictions vs actual values  
- Dark theme with neon highlights for better visibility  
- Fully interactive slicers & tooltips
